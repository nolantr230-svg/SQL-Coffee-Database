# Project Overview:
In this group project a relational database for a coffee shop was designed from scratch, making sure to adhere to all database standards. This database was then programmed in SQL, populated with sample data and then complex queries were performed to extract information from the database.

# How To Run:
To use this database, you will need an application that runs MySQL. Once downloading the coffee_tables_mysql.sql file open your MySQL application and connect to your server. From there double click the database you would like to use for the project, open the sql file with your MySQL application from your files, and copy and paste all of the code to the tab with the database you want to use. Then run the code to create all the tables at once. From there if you woud like to populate the database with sample data you can copy and paste all of the code from coffee_data_mysql.sql into the command line or query window and run it. Then copy and paste the code from coffee_queries_mysql.sql and run it if you would like to use some sample queries provided that test groupby, having, orderby, aggregates, joins, subqueries, etc.
